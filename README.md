# DoctorCall
This is a **console application** written in Java as part of the 1st Individual Exercise of the AFDEMP Coding Bootcamp 6 on January 2019.

The aforementioned application supports the asynchronous communication between a doctor and his/hers patients.
The application also provides a third party access for inspection from a state authority in case of a court order demanding access to the data.
Lastly, logging the communication onto a txt file is supported for all the messages exchanged.
